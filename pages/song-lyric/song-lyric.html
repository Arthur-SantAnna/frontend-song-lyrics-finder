            [Verse 1] I had a dream I got everything I wanted Not what you'd
            think And if I'm bein' honest It might've been a nightmare To anyone
            who might care Thought I could fly (Fly) So I stepped off the
            Golden, mm Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried) Nobody even
            noticed I saw them standing right there Kinda thought they might
            care (Might care, might care) <br /><br />
            [Pre-Chorus] I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake
            up, I see You with me
            <br /><br />
            [Chorus] And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
            Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to If I could change the way
            that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why you hear 'They don't
            deserve you'"
            <br /><br />
            [Verse 2] I tried to scream But my head was underwater They called
            me weak Like I'm not just somebody's daughter Coulda been a
            nightmare But it felt like they were right there And it feels like
            yesterday was a year ago But I don't wanna let anybody know 'Cause
            everybody wants something from me now And I don't wanna let 'em down
            <br /><br />
            [Pre-Chorus] I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake
            up, I see You with me
            <br /><br />
            [Chorus] And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
            Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to If I could change the way
            that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why you hear 'They don't
            deserve you'"
            <br /><br />
            [Outro] If I knew it all then, would I do it again? Would I do it
            again? If they knew what they said would go straight to my head What
            would they say instead? If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
            Would I do it again? If they knew what they said would go straight
            to my head What would they say instead?
